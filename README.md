Module 5 Data-Visualisation Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called Pymaceuticals which contains a pandas code file called Module-5-Challnge which contains the code for all of the data analysis and the graphs. There is also a data folder which contains the raw data files.The pandas codes are annotated for ease of reading and understanding. To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. I learnt how to sort my bar chart in descending order using the sort_values function in my plotting line by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40902958/pandas-dataframe-bar-plot-with-sort-values-by-other-column. I learnt how to drop duplicate rows to make the clean_tumor_data table using the .drop_duplicates function from https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html. I got the reference code for the correct shade of blue and orange required from the pie chart from https://datascientyst.com/full-list-named-colors-pandas-python-matplotlib/. I learnt the enumerate counter for the for loop for quartiles from https://realpython.com/python-enumerate/.
